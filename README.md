# tech4good-hermitcrab
Repo of Hermit Crab team for Tech4Good hackathon organised by Codam and TSH (May 2021).


# Goal of the project
## Challenge
The Hackathon's challenge was to create an improved customer interaction with homeowners who want to renovate their homes. Besides the fact that it's difficult home owners right information and there's no one-size-fits-all solution available at this time, it's also challenging to grasp the full scope of renovation and to make such a large investment upfront.

# Solution and deliverables
We designed the customer interaction and a starter app in Flutter. We educate the users and motivate them to provide information with visual feedback and increasingly precise savings estimation.

### App design
We used Webflow to showcase the structure of the app and the flow of the interaction. You can find it [here](https://tech4good-test2.webflow.io/). You need to open it in the mobile view to display it correctly. Resizing the window will not do it. On Mac, press Cmd + Shift + M or go into developer view and press "Toggle device toolbar". 

### Flutter app
This repo contains the code of the app in Flutter. The app is to showcase the potential implementation of our idea.
