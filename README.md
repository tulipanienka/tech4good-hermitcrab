# tech4good-hermitcrab
Repo of Hermit Crab team for Tech4Good hackathon organised by Codam and TSH (May 2021).


# Goal of the project
## Challenge
The Hackathon's challenge was to create an improved customer interaction with homeowners who want to renovate their homes. Besides the fact that it's difficult home owners right information and there's no one-size-fits-all solution available at this time, it's also challenging to grasp the full scope of renovation and to make such a large investment upfront.

# Solution and deliverables
We designed the customer interaction and a starter app in Flutter. We educate the users and motivate them to provide information with visual feedback and increasingly precise savings estimation.

### App design
We used Webflow to showcase the structure of the app and the flow of the interaction. You can find it [here](https://tech4good-test2.webflow.io/). You need to open it in the mobile view to display it correctly. Resizing the window will not do it. On Mac, press Cmd + Shift + M or go into developer view and press "Toggle device toolbar". 

### Flutter app
This repo contains the code of the app in Flutter. The app is to showcase the potential implementation of our idea. 
The most important files for the app are in the folder: "Hermit_Crab_App/lib/"

### The idea
We recognised problems the homeowners have when it comes to deciding on their house renovation. We decided to implement elements of information about particular aspects of the house to allow the users to educate themselves on why it matters to renovate them and what is the impact they can expect. Additionally, we implemented elements to keep the motivation going - the app main page is an image of a house which will get coloured with every new piece of information about the user's house. Moreover, with every new information, the estimated savings after a house improvement are more precisely calculated. Hence, the users feel rewarded every step they take and are likely to continue and tinish the process.
