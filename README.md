# tech4good-hermitcrab
Repo of Hermit Crab team for Tech4Good hackathon organised by Codam and TSH (May 2021).


# Goal of the project
The Hackathon's challenge was to create an improved customer interaction with homeowners who want to renovate their homes.  


# Solution and deliverables
We designed the customer interaction and a starter app in Flutter. We educate the users and motivate them to provide information with visual feedback and increasingly precise savings estimation.

### App design
We used Webflow to showcase the structure of the app and the flow of the interaction. You can find it [here](https://tech4good-test2.webflow.io/). 

### Flutter app
This repo contains the code of the app in Flutter. The app is to showcase the potential implementation of our idea.
